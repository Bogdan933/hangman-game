Welcome Bogdan933,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## User stories
- The color combination is soothing and fits with everything.
- Leaderboard feature is fun to have.
- Questions were entertaining
- Progress bar is contrast adds to immersion.


## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


### Features Left to Implement


### Testing and fixed Bugs
- The program was tested manually with pep8:

### Validator Testing 



### Unfixed Bugs

- I have a bug at an early stage where the get_valid_letter thinks every letter input is correct and it does not continue the game it just congratulates for winning the game. Will update in future...

## Deployment

This game was deployed to github pages.

- Open the repository settings.
- Go to "pages" (found under "code and automation").
- Choose which branch to build from. You want to choose "main". Do not forget to save the settings.
- (If needed, choose a custom domain)
- Open the repository in github desktop (I used github desktop. You can do this in git too.)
- Choose to create a local clone (the first time you open your repository in github desktop, there should be a window asking if you want to create a clone)
- Copy the link to your deployed website (which can be found in the github pages settings, where you chose which branch to build from) and make sure it is operating as expected.
- The deployed website will now be updated when you push anything new to the repository.

## Credits 



### Content 

__Programs Used__
  - Git was used for using the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to Github.
  - Github - Github was used to store the project code and display the project in Github Pages. (https://github.com/)
 



#### Forking and cloning
- Forking is creating a new repository with the same content as the one you forked. 
    - This is done by going to the repository you want to clone, and clicking the "fork" icon in the top right corner.
- Cloning is used for making local copies of your code.
    - Cloning a repository with github desktop is easily done by clicking the green "code" button and choosing the "open in github desktop" option. If you do not have a clone already, github desktop will ask if you want to create a local clone. Click yes.
    - If you do it with git you have to write "git clone" and then specify what you want to clone.
